PROBLEM STATEMENT:- We have a dataset which consists of features of ROCKS and MINES which is available in kaggle(contains 208 rows or features of objects Rock and Mine. 
                    Use Logistic Regression Model to predict where the given input data is a ROCK OR MINE

In this Project, We build a Machine Learning model which helps us predict whether the object is Rock or Mine.

STEPS TO DO :

--> 1. IMPORT REQUIRED LIBARIES SUCH AS PANDAS, NUMPY, SKLEARN ETC.

--> 2. LOAD THE DATASET INTO OUR SYSTEM.

--> 3. PROCESS THE DATA (SIZE, SHAPE, DESCRIPTION ETC).

--> 4. SPLIT OUR DATA FOR TRAINING AND TESTING.

--> 5. FIT THESE TRAINED DATA INTO OUR LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL.

--> 6. NOW FIND THE ACCURACY OF OUR MODEL WITH BOTH TRAINED AND TESTED DATA.

--> 7. MAKE A PREDICTIVE SYSTEM.

THANKS, I HOPE THIS HELPED YOU TO LEARN SOMETHING.
